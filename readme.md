Spray, once a stand-alone project, now part of Akka, is a toolkit for building and consuming REST services. SoftwareMill CTO and Co-founder Adam Warski demos how to build a simple REST service with Spray, and then consume it with a Spray-based client. He shows that new routes can be added very quickly, how to use type-safe query and path parameters, as well as how to create custom directives, reusing existing code.

This talk was given at the Scala Bay meetup hosted at SumoLogic in SF.
